# Developed 
by: Jon Kelly, Emin Okic, Max Smith, Nathan Schmidt


A productivity application intended for 
*     class management 
*     note-taking
*     schedule planning
*     attendance tracking
****
# Why?
We wanted to develop an app to make life easier for the average person. More specifically, we wanted to make life easier for students and professors.
Instead of using one app to track attendance, one app to plan out your day, and one app to take notes of each class day to day; we decided to make it all in one.
****

The program will have a login system and separate landing pages for different types of users. 
* Students: will have a page that gives them access to add courses, and view current courses 
* Instructors: will be able to take attendance of their courses they are teaching
* System moderators: will be able to delete courses, and see stats.
